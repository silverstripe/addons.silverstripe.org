# SilverStripe Addons

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/addons.silverstripe.org.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/addons.silverstripe.org)

This is the codebase for [addons.silverstripe.org](https://addons.silverstripe.org). It aggregates SilverStripe packages 
from [Packagist](http://packagist.org).

## Setting up a development environment

The development environment is managed with Vagrant. It will provide both a SilverStripe LAMP stack and an ElasticSearch server. Here's how to set it up.

1. `git clone https://github.com/silverstripe/addons.silverstripe.org.git`
2. `cd` into the directory to run some initialisation commands:
   a. `composer install`
   b. `cp .env.default .env`
   c. `touch host.txt`
3. Install vagrant:
   a. Install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
   b. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater vagrant-bindfs vagrant-cachier vagrant-vbguest`
   c. `vagrant box add silverstripeltd/dev-ssp`
4. Run `vagrant up --provision` to start the box
5. Visit (http://ssaddons.vagrant/)[http://ssaddons.vagrant/] to see your development environment.
6. Initialise the database:
   a. Visit [dev/build](http://ssaddons.vagrant/dev/build)
   b. Visit [dev/tasks/queue/UpdateSilverStripeVersionsTask](http://ssaddons.vagrant/dev/tasks/queue/UpdateSilverStripeVersionsTask)
   c. Visit [dev/tasks/queue/UpdateAddonsTask](http://ssaddons.vagrant/dev/tasks/queue/UpdateAddonsTask)
7. Open [queued jobs admin](http://ssaddons.vagrant/admin/queuedjobs/) and verify that the tasks have started.

## Dependencies

### Environment variables

 * `SS_ADDONS_DOWNLOAD_PATH`: Set this to the full path of the folder to download into. Otherwise, a subfolder of the
   SilverStripe temp path will be used.

### ElasticSearch

[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org) is used to provide add-on package indexing and searching. The addons
site runs **ElasticSearch 5.6** on SilverStripe Platform.

The configuration is already set up in `app/_config/injector.yml` and will use a different index depending on 
whether the site is on the production server (live) or on UAT or local development environment (test or dev).

 - Install with `brew install elasticsearch@5.6`
 - Start the server with `elasticsearch` in your terminal

You should run the elastic search reindex task to create the mappings after installation.

Once running you can run the `UpdateAddonsTask` to pull all SilverStripe modules from Packagist into the addons site.

**Note:** if you are having trouble installing this with Homebrew (or not using MacOS), you can also [install
ElasticSearch manually](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/zip-targz.html).

### Queued Jobs

For extended add-on information such as parsed Readme content, a Queued Job is created during the `UpdateAddonsTask`.
Queued Jobs requires a cronjob to run - for more information [visit the module's wiki](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs/wiki/Installing-and-configuring).

## Tasks

Run each of the following tasks in order the first time you set up the site to ensure you have a full database 
of modules to work with.

1. `vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/UpdateSilverStripeVersionsTask`: Updates the available SilverStripe versions.
2. `vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/UpdateAddonsTask`: Runs the add-on updater, and queues extended add-on builds.
3. `vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/DeleteRedundantAddonsTask`: Deletes addons which haven't been updated
   from packagist in a specified amount of time, which implies they're no longer available there.
4. `vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/BuildAddonsTask`: Manually build addons, downloading screenshots
   and a README for display through the website. There's no need to set up a cron job
   for this task if you're using the resque queue.
5. `vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/Heyday-Elastica-ReindexTask`: Defines and refreshes the ElasticSearch index (add
  `?recreate=1` to delete and recreate the index from scratch).

## Front-end build tooling

The site uses [LESS](http://lesscss.org) for compiling CSS.

One way to compile it is through [Grunt](http://gruntjs.org), which requires you to install 
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) first.

```
npm install -g grunt grunt-cli
npm install --save-dev
```

To compile, run:

```
grunt less
```

To watch for file changes, run:

```
grunt watch
```

## API Endpoints

Addons has 3 endpoints that can be used to gather statistics about SilverStripe addons.

### Supported Addons Endpoint

For a list of addons that are marked as supported you can use this endpoint:

```
$ curl http://addons.localhost/api/supported-addons
{
    "success": true,
    "addons": [
        "vendorA/moduleA",
        "vendorB/moduleB"
    ]
}
```

Whether an addon is supported or not is controlled by a boolean field on the `Addon` DataObject.
